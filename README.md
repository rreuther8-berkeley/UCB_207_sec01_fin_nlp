# Reddit - Finance Posts

## Background
This project explores the intersection of behavioral science and social media analytics, specifically utilizing data scraped from Reddit. Our primary objective is to assess what makes a post more engaging.


## Data source: Reddit
There are over 50million logged-in users on reddit (Statista)
Reddit users are predominantly male, young, white, and well-educated: demographics 

## Reddit Dataset metrics:
To understand how popular a post is on Reddit, we focus on the following metrics:
1.	Upvote Ratio: This is a measure of the percentage of upvotes versus downvotes a post receives. A higher upvote ratio indicates that the post is well-received by the community.
2.	Score: This is the net score of the post, calculated as the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. It provides a direct measure of how popular the post is.
3.	Total Awards Received: This indicates how many awards the post has received from other users. Awards are typically given for posts that users find particularly valuable or noteworthy.
4.	Num Comments: The number of comments can indicate the level of engagement and discussion the post has generated.
5.	Num Crossposts: The number of times the post has been crossposted to other subreddits can indicate its relevance and popularity across different communities.
Secondary metrics kept in dataset as they might also be valuable:
1.	Gilded: Indicates how many times the post has received Reddit Gold, a premium award.
2.	Is Video: Indicates if the post contains a video, which can be more engaging and thus popular.
3.	Is Original Content: Indicates if the post is original content, which can sometimes lead to higher engagement if the community values original posts.
Less valuable for measuring popularity:
1.	Pinned: Indicates if the post is pinned by moderators, which doesn't necessarily reflect popularity but rather importance or relevance as determined by the moderators.
2.	Archived: Indicates if the post is archived and no longer open for new comments, which is more about the post's status than its popularity.
3.	Locked: Indicates if the post is locked, preventing further comments. This can happen for various reasons, not necessarily related to popularity.
4.	Removed: Indicates if the post has been removed by moderators or the user, which means it’s not visible anymore and cannot be assessed for popularity.
5.	Deleted: Similar to removed, indicates the post has been deleted.
6.	Is Self: Indicates if the post is a self-post (text post) rather than a link post. This is more about the type of content rather than its popularity.
By focusing on the primary metrics (upvote ratio, score, total awards received, number of comments, and number of cross posts), we can get a good sense of how popular a post is on Reddit, which we believe would indicate how relevant it is on the subject and how much it could be influential in market psychology.

## Effective social media posts:

# How To Make It To The Front Page Of Reddit:

Step 1: you need (and this is in very rough terms) ~4,000 upvotes in a period of less than 6hrs to make it to the front page.

Step 2: Make sure it’s legit/check your sources
Step 3 – Share your post in an appropriate Reddit community
Step 3.5 - Think about the size of the community and the time you’re posting

* Relevance
* Clarity
* Visual Appeal
* Engagement: posts should invite and encourage interaction, feedback and sharing from the audience. Make sure you’re asking questions, offering incentives, creating polls or contests and sharing user-generated content. 
Create a dialogue between you and your audience by responding to comments, acknowledging contributions, thanking followers and building a sense of community.

Behavioral Science Topics:
1.	Cognitive Biases:
o	Understand how cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, recency effect, and social proof influence user engagement.
2.	Emotional Triggers:
o	Study how different emotional triggers (e.g., happiness, anger, sadness) affect user interaction and engagement.
3.	Attention Span:
o	Research the average attention span of social media users and how this impacts post engagement.
4.	Motivation and Rewards:
o	Analyze the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in user engagement on social media platforms.
5.	Social Influence and Norms:
o	Investigate how social influence, peer pressure, and community norms drive engagement and interaction.
Social Media Analytics Topics:
1.	Natural Language Processing (NLP):
o	Use NLP techniques to analyze the sentiment and emotion in Reddit posts and comments.
2.	Engagement Metrics:
o	Define and measure engagement metrics such as upvotes, comments, shares, and click-through rates.
3.	Content Analysis:
o	Study the characteristics of high-engagement posts (e.g., length, structure, multimedia content).
4.	User Behavior Analysis:
o	Track and analyze user behavior patterns, including posting frequency, time of day, and interaction types.
5.	Topic Modeling:
o	Use topic modeling to identify prevalent themes and topics that correlate with high engagement.
Data Science and Machine Learning Topics:
1.	Predictive Modeling:
o	Develop models to predict the engagement level of posts based on various features (e.g., sentiment, topic, user history).
2.	Feature Engineering:
o	Identify and engineer relevant features that impact post engagement.
3.	Classification and Clustering:
o	Use classification algorithms to categorize posts into high and low engagement, and clustering techniques to group similar posts.
4.	Recommendation Systems:
o	Explore how recommendation algorithms can be used to promote engaging content to users.
5.	Time Series Analysis:
o	Apply time series analysis to study trends and patterns in engagement over time.
Reddit-Specific Topics:
1.	Community Dynamics:
o	Understand the dynamics of different subreddits and how community culture influences engagement.
2.	Voting Mechanisms:
o	Analyze how Reddit’s upvote and downvote system affects the visibility and engagement of posts.
3.	Moderation Impact:
o	Study the impact of moderation (e.g., removal of posts, banning of users) on community engagement.
4.	User Reputation:
o	Investigate the role of user reputation (karma) in influencing post engagement and visibility.
