       "      <td>reminder shorts have not covered and are lying in their fintel iborrow reports despite new market regulations and congressional acts to minimize fraud it is still widely and easily practiced today are lying first read this excellent dd about borrow fees and short shares discrepancies why is one source giving us one number and another source giving us a completely different number it doesn t make sense both of them can t be right also it s not like it s a small discrepancy by a percentage or two it s a huge discrepancy and the further you dig into it the more you realize that someone is either really wrong or is blatantly lying people who work on wall st usually aren t wrong they are very good about what they do so that pretty much narrows it down by process or elimination 942 si realistically it s around 600 secondly here s another very interesting dd where our very own autists attempt to calculate short interest it can be anywhere from 200 to as high as 900 obv tells us that the overwhelming majority of retail investors are holding citadel could have not bought back their shares which they absolutely need to do we ve seen the short ladder attacks and hundreds of thousands of shorts borrowed almost daily will continue to lie until they go down in flames third everyone needs a history refresher corporate fraud is something that s always existed and something that will always continue to exist no matter what acts congress passes there s always loopholes to abuse it s not easy to expose it but rest assured it s there the only thing that can expose it is time they can t hide it forever a mistake here and there on a balance sheet or earnings report is fine and might go unnoticed but as time goes by more mistakes will attract prying eyes and eventually open an investigation or audit member enron take for example enron who was able to hide billions of dollars of debt across two solid years before anyone figured it out member worldcom following enron s collapse we got sarbanes oxley act which helped protect investors from fraudulent reporting around the same time the worldcom scandal was exposed where they overstated their assets by over 11 billion get this their scandal went on longer than enron s before it was exposed member the 2008 crash a few years later bear sterans fell in 2008 due to the subprime mortgage crisis if you haven t seen it go watch the big short understand that the shorters the good guys at the time had to hold 2 fucking years before people realized they were right and they ever saw a return as the fat cats continued to lie until the day they went up in flames does this mean we need to hold out til 2023 nope dfv already had you covered and started the wheels rolling last year so does that put the squeeze in 2022 still nope they are hemorrhaging cash and the squeeze is likely to happen sooner rather than later let s take a look at their losses so far shitadel is fucked so far citadel melvin lost 6 billion shorting gme in january alone last monday on march 8th citadel other shorters lost 600 million in one day the next day losses were up to 1 5 billion as reported by yahoo finance and this is only what was reported imagine what wasn t reported citadel has 35 billion in assets while melvin has 8 billion despite managing 43 billion in assets between the two of them losing 500 million edit m not b a day will quickly take a toll on your finances and have you bleed out in around 3 months assuming it s just citadel melvin who are shorting also assuming they haven t liquidated all their assets yet or didn t take on any loans they probably did but getting margin called by the banks is a great thing for our side their collapse is very near be patient it s not every day that you can take down a hedgie for 100 000 gains there are many other examples in the wikipedia corporate scandals page if you are bored they happen almost yearly when corporations lie to the general public about their financial standings hell it s not limited to corporations either people lie in general countries lie it s human nature back in ww2 a lot of german citizens didn t even know they were losing the war until the soviets showed up on their doorstep what interests me more is how the hell they managed to keep it a secret for so long but hey history repeats itself people lie this is nothing new and will continue to happen like i said earlier the bigger the lie the quicker it gets exposed and if it s a big enough lie they can t keep it a secret forever the only thing you need to do is sit back and hold be patient could the squeeze happen today yes what if it doesn t happen today that s okay it ll be postponed for next week or the week after or the month after don t set any dates don t have any expectations just be patient and hold we are close when it happens you ll be pleasantly surprised will be rewarded for holding this shit will be one for the history books and you will be a part of it i like the stock i like to eat crayons not a financial advisor edit 1 m not b typo edit 2 several users including u boneywankenobi clarified something really important there s a lot of misinterpretations regarding shorts and how much they have to buy back in iborrow only pulls data from interactive brokers and this does not represent overall shorts in other words while they may be correct we are still viewing only a slice of the whole pie and we don t know how big or small that slice really is this is why we look at interest rate it is more predictive only citadel knows how many shorts they owe and that information is obviously private u mboubs95 pointed out another great indicator ftds shorts are also being hidden in deep itm calls there are approximately over 100 million worth of options however more data is needed for us to accurate estimate how many shares they are hiding this is obviously for very good reason too edit 3 the yahoo linked i posted where citadel melvin lost 600 million on monday and around 800 million on tuesday isn t limited to just citadel melvin but citadel melvin and other shorters in general which begs the question are there any other hedgies shorting gme i appreciate all the constructive criticism guys i wanna stay as accurate as possible i m still learning one thing is for sure since january we can t find accurate enough numbers to make everyone happy because a lot of information has gone private or doesn t add up with other sources yes i m aware there could be disinformation out in the wild as well use caution hedgies are watching</td>\n",

how do i get away from citadel fuck robinhood what is going on fuck robinhood i m not 100 sure where this post is going so i can t promise i ll answer any of those questions but my goal here is still coherent conversation so maybe someone else might have those answers in the comments idk what is citadel and what do they do a hedge fund wrapped up with an advisory service an execution venue a market maker an ipo partner a sandwich shop etc such megacorps pay firms fractions of a cent to pass each order through them for execution the more orders the brokerage passes along the more they re paid money is involved because the more orders that pass through a particular execution venue first the faster they can make decisions about the direction of the market on both the micro and macro scale this is the current nature of the market order data for new and small traders using self directed firms has been especially valuable the last 20 years because you do things institutions cannot you can open a new position based on a tweet while the major advisory services need to whip out the scales and weigh the cost of moving assets for countless customers at once and that s even further complicated if they re designated fiduciaries because in their book reacting quickly implies that there s unknown risks involved for example they did the numbers on a particular company six months ago and decided it wouldn t be profitable in another six months even in 2021 they just can t move as fast as you but knowing what you re doing is a step closer to them being able to respond sooner with smaller changes rather than react with major changes when shit hits the fan btw the fatal flaw on gme is that they tried to play the old cull the weak game that worked for them for decades and absolutely chose to ignore the direction the market was moving until it was too late if they d used the order flow and other data they re paying so much cash to access and were as bright as they imagine they are it would have been rough but even hardcore shorts could have lived through this week retail investors can pat themselves on the back for exploiting it but melvin capital got fucked by hubris and lack of awareness not to get all rza between songs on it but that s why the title of this sub has been welcome to the machine for a long time now the major players know you dream of making it big buying a car having a steak and all the other things roger wrote about just by doing something you enjoy playing guitar but it could be your art you talents in math or science taps in a mobile game or in this instance investing and they ll welcome you in with open arms convince you that they ll be a guide and there to help knowing they ll get a cut just by letting you do what you do and finding a way to package it people over simplify it with if the service is free you are the product because they don t notice that the machine will also make you pay if it can money for order flow has made it easier for others to provide the space for you to do what you do without noticing they re cashing in even if you don t but don t forget that the machine can be other investors the machine can be the large firms the machine can be investment advice columnists hedge funds and brokerages aren t the only machine operators in the financial industry which firms use citadel and which ones don t they all use citadel i m not joking i ve kept up to date on execution venues people probably thought i was just lecturing them about understanding order flow here but i dislike virtu as a venue and apex as a clearing firm which i ve talked about here for years and the concentration of orders being fed to the short list of venues has not changed in a positive way because that s where the money is the idea for this post came to me this morning because no news article no tv interview and not a single hot take on twitter i ve read so far has managed to mention just how embedded citadel individually is in the modern market i had aoc s live stream on in the background last night and even the guests seemed to imply that citadel is a little firm propping up robinhood and that nobody could have seen this blowing up one day these relationships even down to how much money is paid are public by law every quarter both sides are required to release data on order flow in 605 raw and 606 607 reports here s a quick rundown of places i could come up with off the top of my head that use citadel as their primary or secondary execution venue and what percentage of orders for s p 500 listed securities they recently sent through citadel firm market orders marketable limit orders e trade 36 33 37 16 schwab 31 61 30 06 tda 60 04 59 25 edward jones 36 91 47 49 webull 50 85 53 71 interactive

sending orders away when they require liquidity alpaca is an api first firm which i like and talk about on discord sometimes because i wish rh would open their api but they re still backed by apex which i dissuade everyone from getting involved with because penson financial services iex is a closed loop exchange that internally clears orders among customers great source for free order data to test algos apex is the clearing agent for many smaller firms including public com betterment acorns m1 rize stockpile stash now when you look at that list remember three things that 99 9 of the remaining orders are going to wolverine virtu 2 sigma and other hedge fund adjacent venues for execution brokerages were doing the same back when they were also charging commissions i don t feel firms being paid for order flow is inherently wrong but whatever agreement citadel has in place to force firms to act in citadel s best interest over customers and even over the brokerage s own best interest is difficult to wrap my mind around right now which brings me to my next point citadel s most loyal sources for order flow robinhood tda webull and ib all fell in line and limited trading at least part of the day the agreements between these companies and citadel are obviously not public but i m sure citadel has them bent over a contractual barrel that left them with no choice but to comply as a customer of half of those firms i say they should have done whatever they could to explain the actual situation to the public spoilers it wasn t risk on the retail side taken whatever penalties citadel could impose for ignoring them all the way up to breach of contract etc and fight that out in court rather than act in ways that seems to have only punished and confused customers corporate level decision making is so fucking stupid where to go fino if iex was larger that would be a decent alternative for equities but they don t have a silly app that looks good in screenshots but tells you nothing useful i can t think of a self directed firm that can currently exist without citadel and the rest if you do post about it i guess more things i for sure do not know but hope someone wants to talk about i don t know shit about the legality of anything that has gone on this week with robinhood and no i will not be a part of any lawsuit because i was not effected by what happened because i don t have any options or equity holdings in robinhood and cannot claim damages stop asking me i m not even sure if splitting corporations up anti trust style would work for this for sure it was citadel s vested interest that cascaded down to firms and then users but i don t know of any cases that forced divestiture on that scale hedge funds with cases in a friendly district could make a valid claim that they cannot function without access to both order data and current assets it ll be interesting to see if anything changes over the next few years and how disclosure doxxing myself more and more but i worked for a market analytics quantitative research firm in the city that was eventually gobbled up by virtu i d moved abroad months earlier anyway but we loved that job and they only wanted the algos we d designed so fuck virtu my current day job makes trading public companies complex which is why i only talk about algotrading eth on discord most of my self directed play money is still with tda haven t made a trade there or on rh in almost three years but the majority of my family s assets my retirement my kid s inheritances and college funds and on and on have been handled by gs for nearly two decades and likely will continue to be even after i return to the private sector now what would be sweet is if goldman sachs would extend their investment arm which sends orders directly to exchanges to the general public like they have with their marcus savings accounts if they could devise a way to legally pass a good percentage of all would be dependent on volume of the security etc orders directly to the floor as a bundle they d break even at best on it but that would actually democratize the market</td>\n",

       "      <td>live charting for 3 15 2021 predicting the day s price action in detail with warden predicting the dips special edition let s find the juiciest dips again to reiterate since this should probably be at the top this is not financial nor investment advice these are ideas and opinions for information purposes only this post will read bottom to top it s easier for people to refresh the page and see edits at the top add me on twitter i ll be using that as a backup location to post notifications in the event of a reddit outage here is my youtube i may post videos in my future and build my channel out after gme is over historical support and resistance levels for reference today 234 243 250 253 256 5 263 267 272 275 279 282 285 edit 44 3 05 pm the price action today is certainly unsettling that is perfectly normal given that gme is not a stock in play right now the price action today reminds me of trading during a bear market a lot of uncertainty and lots of dips just know that this stock is way below vwap if we don t correct upwards today we may correct later on in the week volume picking up but still low let s see if there s anything in store for us during power hour edit 43 2 40 pm the relationship between borrow rate and availability of shares to short is an inverse relationship when you have fewer shares to lend out as a brokerage you will want to charge a higher fee to offset the low supply so you can make the same amount of money as you can see the spike back in april was due to a low supply why was there a low supply it could have been due to a constant hammering of the stock when it was climbing slow and steadily as you can see now it seems there was a lack of demand and thus an excess of supply for shares to short during our recent runup we are seeing a slight decrease in available shares but compared to april the fee is very low right now it s unusual to me that the borrow rate has not yet risen in response to the decrease in share availability edit 42 2 32 pm this is what i expect i will explain more in edit 43 how borrow fee relates to price and available shares to short edit 41 2 12 pm i believe that it is strange to see a low borrow fee right now because that s an indicator of an abundance of shares available to short this is occurring during a potential uptrend too i honestly believe we have a shares don t exist problem where are these available to short shares coming from just how many synthetic longs and ftds are there this is all highly unusual to me edit 40 1 42 pm for those of you curious about the borrow fee the short borrow fee is a highly important indicator for the short squeeze historically borrow fee will go up before the short squeeze begins furthermore the shares to borrow needs to go to near 0 as of now according to tony oz there are still 1 3m available shares to short alone in interactive brokers as you can see by this highly technical diagram the borrow fee has yet to spike up to around 80 like it did in january this is highly strange edit 39 1 15 pm for those wondering why i haven t made nearly as many predictions today as i have made in previous posts this has to do with the fact that gme is not a stock in play a stock in play is a stock with significant volume caught in the middle of a correction or a trend last week it was caught in a downwards correction that still trended positive with volume higher than today so far though we had a good upwards trend and premarket gap up today it s evident that the opening volume was quite low around 660k in the first minute one telling sign of a stock in play is the price action is fast and choppy today it was sort of like that at market open but it s evident from staring at the chart that the price is barely moving day traders prefer to trade only stocks in play when volume is too low the price action is often meaningless and usually just white noise for that reason i do not find predicting gme s movements today to be particularly useful edit 38 1 00 pm for apes wondering how to spot short attacks one way to tell is a sudden pick up in volume typically during a selloff you will see a gradual increase in volume a short attack is characterized by a sudden spike in volume edit 37 12 52 pm boring chart today eh for those who want to pass the time edit 36 12 26 pm today has shaped out to be an indecisive low certainty day if it weren t for the short attack gme would be bullish and outperforming the market sometimes i question what the purpose of shorting is when it artificially disrupts trends yes i know it s to disrupt momentum i meant that i don t think shorting makes sense for the health of the market it undermines investor confidence edit 35 12 17 pm voo getting ready for a small correction again this should drag the current support levels a bit lower than 250 243 and 234 are fair candidates we ll correct before we bounce edit 34 12 05 pm keep in mind not all whales loading up at the dip are playing for a short term squeeze some are going long well into next year this is good for us more whales holding is good edit 33 11 56 am we should eventually retrace to 263 it s a long way up and may take a long time i m gonna go get lunch and let the price cook a bit should be a period of consolidation followed by a breakout to the upside edit 31 11 37 am remember that gme is affected by broader moves guess what s p 500 tumbled dragging gme with it edit 29 11 26 am given that they chose today to do the short attack my price target needs to be lowered lowered by how much i don t know today s chart is now quite artificial from that drop so it s hard to say edit 28 11 24 am bottom is out edit 27 11 21 am thank you for the firesale melvin and friends edit 26 11 19 am short attack go get a drink nothing interesting happening edit 25 11 14 am we may go as low as 250 251 broader market going down voo ready to fall again edit 24 11 13 am next dip target is 259 261 range edit 23 11 12 am nevermind right as i finished the edit the dip came lol edit 22 11 11 am an unlikely dip at 263 264 range btw if the broader market goes lower it s possible it will drag gme down again unlikely but look out for it edit 21 11 03 am if you were wondering how i spotted the dip around 267 at 10 58 am you ll notice there are plateaus and periods where the price stayed flat some of these were attributed to hedge funds accidentally running essentially buy the dip high frequency trading algorithms on leh the most disappointing hft program known today is the so called buy the new low program a stock will make a new intraday low which will make many day traders go short and ride the downside momentum the program will then start buying the shorts from the day traders and ultimately push the stock higher causing all of the day traders to panic and cover it sounds pretty effective especially since the institutions that run these hft programs have essentially unlimited buying power the problem with this algorithm is when another large institutional seller is behind the trade and wants to dump their large positions no matter how many shares the program buys the stock will never push higher the more the program buys the more the institutional seller and day traders will dump their shares on it this algorithm failed miserably in september 2008 when the investment bank lehman brothers ticker leh now de listed after bankruptcy federal home loan mortgage corp ticker fre and many other mortgage holdings and investment banks all started a massive downward drop in price programs were trying to buy their stock to squeeze and burn the short sellers but since those stocks were already fundamentally broken their stock price never went higher day traders and huge institutional sellers dumped their shares on the program those programs and their developers were obliterated left holding a literally huge number of worthless shares of leh and fre and other bankrupted holdings how to day trade for a living by aziz so basically they bought a bunch of crap leh stock trying to cause a short squeeze that was never going to happen our favorite fraud kjetill stjerne did something similar it was an in between of nick leeson and buy the new low edit 19 10 50 am before the financial crisis of 08 interest rates were low and there were many reasons the housing markets looked appealing people took out subprime mortgages basically a type of home loan issued to people with low credit scores these mortgages were issued at an adjustable rate the problems come in when the interest rates are adjusted up and all of a sudden the perceived value of real estate went down a lot so for the lehman brothers who were heavily involved in the housing market with their mortgage backed securities 76 billion dollars when people begin defaulting not paying on their mortgages this is terrible for their company not only that they invested in real estate themselves their investments tumbled in value in edit 20 we ll explore leh and how hedge funds accidently tried to prop up leh edit 18 10 47 am potential dip at 267 268 5 range btw edit 17 10 44 am seeing how boring the price action is right now let me tell you guys a second story the story of lehman brothers and the housing crisis the lehman brothers was one of the largest bankruptcies of all time the company was 150 years old at the time of bankruptcy in this story i will tell you about another failure in the history of propping up prices how hedge funds accidentally tried to prop up the housing market and how it failed miserably stay tuned for edit 19 edit 16 10 34 am we re consolidating nicely notice how rsi is staying nicely in the blue zone this is extremely bullish especially when the broader market is in the red edit 15 10 30 am singlehandedly leeson bankrupted barings bank i remember when i was visiting a trading company in new york a couple years ago a head trader told me this story it was a lesson in how not to do risk management at your company leeson originally started with something like a 10k loss and let that snowball into a 100 million dollar loss that he tried to fix with nikkei too bad his luck is literally 0 so how does this relate to kjetill stjerne well on jan 29 stjern ran a big wall algorithm to soak up gme shares just like how leeson bought more nikkei futures in an attempt to prop up the price the idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the ease with which the past is explained daniel kahneman thinking fast and slow i remember he posted a tweet that was something like i m ruined no shit sherlock edit 14 10 17 am volume still quite low btw s p bounced from a low today but seems to be consolidating back to the story imagine betting on the s p 500 recovering from a dip and then having a hurricane wiping out the power in the entire country that s what the kobe earthquake was like but worse when the nikkei was free falling nick leeson tried to prop it up by buying more and more nikkei to try to reverse the trend at one point he was long 7 billions dollars on nikkei futures this is like the opposite of what melvin and friends did last wednesday and you know how that went so leeson miserably fails nikkei continues to plummet and now barings bank is holding a bunch of worthless nikkei futures the story continues in edit 15 edit 13 10 11 am let me tell you guys a little story and why i think kjetill stjerne the viking of stocks is a fraud ever heard of barings bank and the rogue trader nick leeson was a trader at barings bank who made risky bets in the options market he began having an unlucky streak losing millions of dollars so he bet big on the recovery of an asian index nikkei on the very day he needed it to recover in one big stroke of bad luck the kobe earthquake shook japan and his plan to make money from nikkei to offset his loses never materialized the story continues in edit 14 coming soon edit 12 10 06 am please upvote this post if you are enjoying the commentary and would like to help me increase visibility of this post edit 11 10 03 am as of now the price is barely moving even with a high bid ask spread volume is too low to induce volatility i ll be pausing my predictions commenting on any broader market events i discover and resume my predictions when volume ramps up there s nothing interesting happening as of now edit 10 9 53 am extremely low volume right now it s dead quiet for gme other stonks like pltr have decent volume something s up and i bet they will ramp it up mid day expect a boring morning p edit 9 9 48 am folks the s p 500 is in the red i wouldn t be surprised if we hit the 267 level hfts will drag gme lower edit 8 9 45 am edit 5 9 38 am dip possible entry at 274 275 edit added 275 range edit 4 9 36 am it s just seeing a minor correction still not really a juicy dip or anything edit 3 9 33 am we should see a lot of upwards pressure now for this special spot the dips edition i ll be focusing my predictions not on how high it goes but when i think it will dip again stay tuned edit 2 9 32 am scenario a confirmed it hit a lower support line than expected what a juicy dip edit 1 9 30 am juicy dip right now begin reading here goooooooooooooood morning my bombastic interplanetary apes daylight savings aggggh i wanna sleep some more i hope you all had a restful weekend spent adopting gorillas and strapping on your astronaut suits for our upcoming trip to the freakin moon i hope you didn t let fud get to you over the weekend because melvin and friends are itching to buy those shares from you for anything below a discount of 100k per share thoughts on contradictory dd i know recently many of you may be angry or disappointed with last week s expectations of a gamma squeeze not coming true that s a perfectly normal reaction do not let it get to you i hope that what i m about to tell you will help dispel fud and help strengthen your convictions last week many people realized that there were conflicting dds that were all right in their own way but contradicted each other they are all right why if you end up working at a wall street firm they ll set you up with a desk and teach you their strategy every firm has multiple desks and each section employs a basket of strategies i ve had the pleasure to visit the trading floor of one of these firms in the past back when i wanted to become a trader fulltime they have halls in these floors in one area you would find the forex traders in another cubicle you ll find the equities desk within each of the sections there s groups of traders executing different strategies just look at all the types of strategies an options trader can employ these don t even include arbitrage techniques it really makes more sense to interpret things like options activity in the lens of basket strategies it s honestly friggin impossible to make simple statements based off options data the options stuff i examined in my previous dd were a bit more obvious but you really can t just assume a long whale is buying all the 260 calls half of those might be used for conversions the other half might be used in collars heck they might even be covered calls the point is it s impossible to tell what these options will be used for we can only really catch the obvious ones and make reasonable guesses in my opinion last week s 800 dollar calls were low risk low return covered calls not some long whale thoughts on strategy the power of trends so what s my point don t let options activity fool you it s a lot more complicated than just long whales and short whales it s a chaotic pit of strategies fighting each other nevertheless i personally believe in the power of trends and that traders will gravitate towards strategies that amplify the trend until that trend shows a sign of weakness and reversal for example the simple long call strategy the long call spread or long combination strategy are all strategies that force mms to hedge and buy more shares this is profitable and creates a self feedback loop amplifying the upwards trend it only stops working when people begin running out of buying power and whales begin hedging and setting up strategies for a reversal we ain t running out of buying power anytime soon stimmies i believe melvin and friends tried to induce this reversal early last wednesday and failed miserably gme is not reversing anytime soon if you see a dip this week that is probably a cornered rat trying to fight the trend it really makes no sense that this trend will reverse anytime soon there are way too many catalysts people are holding institutions are holding all technical indicators are bullish i mean just check out this latest bloomberg terminal screenshot retail during wednesday basically no retailers sold in fact we ve since increased retail ownership from 7 35 to 7 49 this is excellent news what s even greater about this week is that retailers now have stimmies coming in slowly i ve collected some data and it seems that they are slowly trickling in polls show around 10 20 have already gotten their stimmies over the weekend our buying power has increased institutions i anticipate institutions are doing the same in fact institutions like talking to each other as trading desks have direct lines setup with other firms what alliances they ve established nobody except they know but i can speculate that they know exactly the situation shorts are in and the power they have holding this position together institutions are holding and their buying power has also increased this is because the premiums on calls have decreased allowing them to setup more trend amplifying options strategies catalysts stimmies 2nd hearing earnings call highest options activity week stimmies and the hearing will increase certainty the market loves certainty a nice steady climb should be absolutely expected given the increased buying power of retail and institutions our combined holding and all of the catalysts lined up i am incredibly bullish for this week i believe it is highly probably today we will strongly outperform the market forget about 3 19 forget about dates look at this from a strategy perspective we have a series of bullish events lined up like dominoes we just need one of them to fall to set all the other dominoes into motion technicals technical indicators however brainless they are look exceptionally bullish again in my opinion indicators are quite brainless i examine trend and interpret it from a market dynamics viewpoint this image below screams hey as an institution i should hold and at the same time execute strategies that amplify this trend i believe we will have our second bull run this week premarket analysis broader market gap up today s p 500 starting in the green what s interesting today is ust10y last wednesday not only did whales hammer the stock with conversions they did it during an opportune time no those dips in other stocks was probably not hedge funds liquidating their positions to cover gme that s nonsense it was a normal sell off as the us 10 year treasury bonds spiked the fuck up high 10 year yield sell off and market panic a seems more likely as a lot of swing traders made money from this premarket gap up and rally not only that a lot of swing medium frequency trading algorithms like to sell off right at market open option b will happen only if more buyers flood in than sellers my price target today by linear extrapolation is 281 291 conservative and 300 324 high estimate at the bottom of every post now i will include the resources i use to learn summary of resources i used to learn i would recommend technical analysis of the financial markets by murphy and how to day trade for a living by aziz you can find the free pdfs online i watch humbled trader on youtube she s legit and really knows what she s doing roensch capital is excellent for some more deep dive technical analysis i also read a lot of investopedia and learned about options trading from the online websites options playbook and theoptionsguide understand options is important for understanding trends sentiment and where prices should go being able to read and understand the options chain is important i use several tools at my disposal namely optionistics for understanding iv and option price trends barchart for options chain optionsonar for scanning for unusual options activity webull for charting and level 2 data and stockcharts for their bond charts thinkorswim for quick news scanning and stonk o tracker for ssr data i check tradingview for amateur trading ideas just to make sure i haven t missed anything i like to read form

       "      <td>due diligence of bitcoin mining stock valuations riot and mara due diligence of bitcoin mining stock valuations riot and mara unlike the 2017 18 rise of bitcoin the 2020 21 bitcoin price action has been largely driven and influenced by institutional demand with institutional demand comes institutional products we have seen bitcoin derivatives bitcoin trusts and more recently a new way for exposure to bitcoin price action publicly traded bitcoin mining companies there are two bitcoin mining companies which i d like to review for you here both trade on nasdaq they are riot and mara lets begin with a quick summary on bitcoin mining what is bitcoin mining to mine a new block on the bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a nonce the cryptographic combination of the nonce next block content must be numerically smaller than the network s difficulty target more on this below generating a new nonce is extremely computationally expensive there is no shortcut miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result they are trying to find the answer to a math problem a nonce that hashes correctly with the sha 256 cryptographical hashing function the bitcoin network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks this is called the difficulty the aim is to have a new block mined approximately every 10 minutes this means that if the mining power is doubled the difficulty is made 2x harder double the energy for the same amount of bitcoin we can see an estimate for the total hash rate being applied to the bitcoin network today notice that it is about 150m th s right now 150 million trillion nonces tried every second so for every block every 10 minutes 9 10 22 attempts are done 90 sextillion until one lucky participant finds a valid nonce and can mine the next bitcoin block in doing so they get rewarded 6 25 newly generated bitcoin some bitcoin in transaction fees from users of the network you can run code on your computer to try and find the next bitcoin block in fact this is how all bitcoin mining used to be done however these days you will end up spending more on electricity than you mine in bitcoin this is because people have developed special asic chips designed specially for brute forcing the sha 256 function these chips are a factor of 100 times more efficient than your computer mining on an asic bitcoin miner the biggest producer of asic bitcoin miners is a chinese company called bitmain they produce miners run many of the miners and even run many mining pools where people can collectively search for the next block and split the profits bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in bitcoin this is because there is a lag while new bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture excess profit so lets take a look at how profitable it is to run an asic miner today the antminer s19 pro is one of bitmain s latest machines it can run an impressive 110 th s and uses 3250w of power on their website bitmain is listing them at 3769 per machine but in bulk companies can buy them for as low as 2333 notice they are sold out until at least august so 2333 machine cost using 0 08 kwh electricity costs benchmark for electricity cost in china we get 3 25kw 0 08 0 26 per hour in electricity costs assuming we run 24 7 this gives us 0 26 24 365 2278 in electricity costs per year and how many bitcoin will we mine well at 110 th s on an asic machine we are capturing 110 150 000 000 0 0000733 of the total bitcoin network per machine at current total hash rate 52 560 bitcoin blocks mined per year 6 25 bitcoin reward per block 1 25 bitcoin in transaction fees avg right now 7 5 bitcoin per block 52 560 blocks 394 2k bitcoin per year for the entire network 0 0000733 of this is 0 289 bitcoin per machine per year 14 450 revenue at 50k per bitcoin 14 450 2278 12 2k profit per year you can play with the parameters to figure out different profit levels for example if the total hash rate doubled to 300m th s profit per machine would drop to 5k per year also note that transaction fees fluctuate over time depending on how many people are actually using bitcoin sending and receiving transactions see historic transaction fees and how long can you run a machine for running so many calculations slows a machine quickly additionally new faster hardware is introduced making past hardware unprofitable fairly quickly as a rule of thumb we can expect a machine to be profitable for about 2 years this is also the rate at which companies mark the depreciation of miners on their balance sheet in year 2 the machines become much less profitable than initially there have been studies to see where bitcoin mining is occurring through ip address analysis of miners working in pools the university of cambridge has a real time map in which we can see that in 2020 mining was country total hash rate china 69 russia 6 us 5 kazakhstan 5 malaysia 4 iran 4 riot and mara now that we have a basic overview of how bitcoin mining works let s look our new investment phenomenon publicly traded nasdaq listed bitcoin mining companies riot incorporated in july 2000 the company was renamed to riot blockchain in october 2017 the company now exclusively mines bitcoin and has a partnership with coinmint llc in new york who operate the miners riot was a penny stock for most of its existence and was irrelevant until mid 2020 how many miners do they have current status of pre dec 2020 orders 11 5k miners in operation and 10k more to be delivered funded from 100m secondary offering in oct 2020 in december 2020 their stock price rocketed alongside bitcoin 3 15 in 1 5 months they took advantage of this and ran a secondary offering raising 200m with this money they ordered 15k more miners for 35m expected delivery starts in may 2021 with the bulk to be delivered in october 2021 summary 37 640 machines at full deployment 11 5k machines today and won t be running the rest until q3 q4 so ignoring the cost of the machines operational 11 5k machines at 12 2k profit per year per machine 137m full capacity q3 q4 37 6k machine at 12 2k profit per year per machine 459m and assets maybe 150m in cash btc left over from secondary offering and past assets note they may get cheaper electricity costs through their partnership and claim as low as 0 0014 per kwh in some releases mara incorporated in 2010 the company has a wild history it first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium then real estate in southern california and most recently patent trolling the company has some questionable leadership and has also been a penny stock for most of its existence in 2019 i think the company began delving into bitcoin mining in september 2019 they purchased 6k s9 bitmain miners 13 5 th s for 4m notice that at 13 5 th s these machines are far from profitable today i m not even sure they were profitable back then so more recently they own current status of pre dec 2020 orders 6 5k miners in operation and 30k more to be delivered funded from 100m secondary offering in aug 2020 in december 2020 ran another secondary offering after their stock price went from 2 14 in a month they raised 200m with this money they ordered 70k more miners delivery of 7k in july 63k in december for 168m in january 2021 they ran yet another secondary offering raising 300m more they used 150m of this to buy 4 8k bitcoin at 31k per coin summary operational 6 5k miners 79m per yr full capacity dec 2021 103k miners 1 25bn per yr they also made 90m on their bitcoin holdings so far 150m 240m impressive numbers right well too good to be true so what are riot and mara trading at you may ask with the recent jump of bitcoin to 50k riot and mara have rocketed riot closed at 77 90 per share a market cap of 5 3bn mara closed at 47 90 per share a market cap of 4 5bn investor euphoria is at all time highs so much so that their price action has rapidly outpaced and diverged from bitcoin so is it because they have such huge potential if riot gets all of its hardware delivered is it really going to be making 459m per year and mara 1 25bn per year well probably not as bitcoin price goes up mining becomes very profitable and there is a rush to build and deploy more hardware from oct to dec 2017 the price of bitcoin famously went from 4k to 20k total hash rate went up about 60 during this time however it went up a massive 600 over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployed with a lag as the price of bitcoin capped out and then dipped mining soon became unprofitable at such a high total hash rate and miners lost a lot of money both riot and mara are pending receipt of the majority of their miners and won t be taking delivery until late 2021 early 2022 what will the network s total hash rate be by then what will bitcoin price be by then chinese miners won t be sitting by idle and we ignored the cost of the machines in the future riot and mara will need to buy new machines regardless of the market the old asic miners will quickly trend towards unprofitability bitcoin is closed system there will only be a maximum of 328 5k tx fees of bitcoin mined per year in fact this will reduce in 2024 with the next halving a company cannot reliably mine more bitcoin capture more of the network because if they are finding it profitable to increase their hash rate then you can be certain every other miner is doing the same how many 100m secondary offerings can they do for this free lunch take a look at the past financials of these companies riot mined an impressive 2 4m worth of bitcoin in q3 2020 their costs were 1 3m in electricity rent etc 1 2m depreciation 2 5m once you add in their 2m of salaries and marketing they had an operating loss of 2 1m for the quarter their bitcoin did appreciate by a cool 385k meaning their net loss for the quarter ended at 1 7m of course their next quarter should look wildly better thanks to bitcoins q4 2020 price action but this is not a business that is massively profitable under normal market conditions the bull case bitcoin keeps rocketing and never comes back the total hash rate doesn t catch up and 50k btc becomes 1m btc mara s 1 25bn revenue next year becomes 12 5bn before asic miner production catches up investors doubled their money of course if it becomes so profitable one wonders if bitmain decides it is better value to use the miner s themselves and breach their contract tobin s q simply stated when you invest in a riot or mara you are investing in the profitability unprofitability of bitcoin mining over the next 1 2 years it could be hugely profitable or it could crash and burn like it did in 2018 and you see no returns in this instance you are paying the executive team of mara and riot to buy the hardware plug it in and sell any bitcoin for you there isn t much more to it than that you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity so perhaps a good way to see what kind of premium you are paying to own bitcoin miner exposure through these nasdaq companies is the q ratio the q ratio is the market cap of the company divided by the replacement costs of its assets riot market cap 5 3bn current btc miners 11 5k 27m ordered btc miners 26k 60m 150m cash remaining guess a whopping q ratio of 22 4 and 63 of that is cash 25 in orders mara market cap 4 5bn current btc miners 6 5k 15m ordered btc miners 96 5k 225m 240m in bitcoin 100m cash remaining guess a value q ratio of 7 75 with this approach riot is trading at a 22 4x premium today and mara a 7 75x a criticism of this valuation methodology may be that it is justified paying a premium when orders for new hardware are so backlogged just remember that these companies are also stuck in that backlog and won t have most of their machines online until 2022 is it really worth such a premium other factors to consider these companies have questionable management the ceo of mara has awarded himself compensation in excess of 300m over the last few months realise that the market cap of mara was less than 300m just 3 months ago both companies are quick to do secondary offering after secondary offering at such high prices mara has been more aggressive recently and the downward pressure of insider selling and secondary share offerings has resulted in the price moving from 20 48 in the time riot has gone from 20 77 a read through both of their 10 qs will give you paragraphs of legal claims shareholder class actions and past investment write offs due to corruption shady circumstances these companies have no moat they have no ip they have no key talent hires they are simply ordering asic miners plugging them in and having the biggest pay days of their lives trading strategies so is there a trading strategy i would recommend bear the challenge with being a bear in this market is you have to seriously consider whether the risk reward is there for betting on the downside right now the market doesn t care for your fundamentals bitcoin has passed 50k the narrative is that its going to 100k the market expects these stocks to continue to trade at multiples and be 10x higher in a month it sounds ridiculous but it keeps happening it is far too dangerous to be short these stocks or worse short calls and you could be bankrupt on 1 intra day move so that leaves you with puts average implied vol nearing 300 does not make them cheap if you truly have conviction that there will be a correction in the near term then consider weekly bear spreads longer dte plays are insanely expensive and run the risk of the many secondary offerings eventually justifying a price higher than your price target another interesting idea would be a relative trade if you could find exposure to bitcoin mining at 20x premium your long run earnings could net out however all publicly traded companies are similarly ludicrous so you d have to buy a stake in btc mining privately or try and own some asic miners yourself more simply you could go long bitcoin and short riot mara this should converge in the long run the risk is that short term the short position will be impossible to risk manage and there is always the risk of more secondary offerings bull buy as far otm weekly calls as you can at 400 iv and hope that momentum market continues fundamentals are for the 2010s other both riot and mara s stock price spent some time consolidating down from 28 to the 16 22 range when bitcoin corrected back from its initial 45k run up back to to 30k it is possible they will again if bitcoin has a pullback however the price action of these stocks has diverged even from bitcoin for the time being ultimately the price action we are seeing now is purely momentum hype technical and probably retail driven long term and as far as future earnings go this play is a loser but be careful that doesn t seem to matter right now disclaimer this is not financial advice do your own dd and trade at your own risk positions i hold 1 60 50 put debit spread for feb 26th for each company tldr bitcoin mining stock valuations are about as crazy as the valuations of all growth stocks in this market fuelled by retail demand of people who don t know what a blockchain is but their crypto millionaire friend told them its revolutionary the greater fool investing 101</td>\n",

       "      <td>i made 500 000 trading stocks and options in 18 months these are the 15 things i did that worked best i failed a lot while trading before during and after succeeding i haven t counted it up but it s likely i encountered losses in excess of 150 000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided rash decisions and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies net net i m up 500 000 but i was asked to share some of what worked for me over im quite a bit after my last post and figured i d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way as i did these are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation someone trying to increase net worth not increase income and they may not be suitable for everyone understand the trading environment one mistake i made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment i was in before picking out a strategy what do i mean i need to know where things are in the year in relation to earnings season and in relation to sector rotations i need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and i need to watch the vix mind the gap between earnings seasons i can t stress this enough when earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in investors watch those like hawks good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market in between earnings seasons there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation 10 year bond yields and what the fed is doing this makes for a much jumpier market that s more likely to pull back it s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios they manage billions so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class e g value stocks energy and underweight in other asset classes e g growth stocks technology i try not to get caught by these patterns i anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly simply put i buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule of course i don t do this if i expect a terrible earnings season take advantage of sector rotations the sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year i do this by plotting sector etfs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside if i run the p e ratios for the sector etfs i can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 p e vs other sectors that are more modestly valued just keep in mind that certain sectors like tech will always be valued more richly given their growth so looking at p e ratios is not apples to apples it s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range last year s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year this is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high i don t bet against this trend it s been around longer than i have and will continue to be around long after i m dirt last year you couldn t give away a barrel of oil last week oil reached 80 a barrel one of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector etfs that underperformed the previous year i buy calls with expirations in 6 9 months knowing that i will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100 gain sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year other times it takes 9 months so long as i don t overpay for the options it works i don t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector for example if the sector etf averages a 10 annual return and the etf price is 100 i m not going to buy a call for more than 10 that way if the sector only moves 5 i can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough make the vix your friend the vix is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks if the vix goes up the market is worried if it goes down the market is getting bullish if it stays up everyone is on edge it s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button so be careful buying during times when the vix is high on the flip side if the market has pulled back and the vix starts to retreat away from its highs that makes for a good entry point another interesting phenomenon is when the vix is higher than normal there tends to be a selloff the friday before a long weekend this happens because investors don t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their tuesday with losses piling up i ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day friday or to run some weekly puts on thursday afternoon before the dips selecting trades investments have an allocation plan the first thing i recommend is determining in advance the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies anything shorter term is higher risk higher reward i break my portfolio in the following buckets 25 long term market investment using equity etfs that largely track the spx or do a breakdown between bonds and the market i use vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called calf i will not touch this money for 15 years 25 cash i like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare this way if a black swan event happens i not only have money to invest i have money to live on should things go bad for a while this philosophy enabled me to buy options when covid hit in 2020 without worrying if i could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job it s also very useful if i have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions i took this from buffet fwiw 30 options mostly in tax advantaged accounts iras i aim for a 50 annual return overall with this portfolio though it fluctuates a lot year to year 10 long term blue chips stocks like visa apple msft etc i defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur that can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls 6 long term bets in a roth ira these are equities i think all have a chance at a 10x return but that will take 5 10 years it s a lot of ipos small tech companies and biotechs i have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40 50 on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it this is a new strategy for me so i ll let you know in 10 years if it works 3 leveraged hedges these are puts on my own positions stocks or the market at large generally i use vix calls buy puts occasionally buy calls on the spxs and run strangles on investments betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts 1 in other things i can t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe use technologies to find ideas unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are ok getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends you need to use tools to help you locate investment trade ideas and be willing to pay for them i value my time and am willing to pay 5 of my portfolio a year if it saves me time and more if it generates higher returns i ve tried about a dozen or so services including stock picking services like fool and investorsplace ultimately i decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because i did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps so i switched to analytics tools and my fidelity platform my favorite tools to use are zack s vgm score levelfields and fidelity the zack s vgm measures a stock s value growth rate and momentum it s an easy screen i can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at the caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99 of the way they are going to move so you need to keep an eye on what s new to the list to avoid losing money that part is crucial the list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6 9 months warning they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit i use fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price a friend recently turned me on to an ai tool called levelfields they have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically it helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid cap companies you don t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites they often send alerts on company events before there s any news out which is really helpful the interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen so it s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success i use it a lot for pinpointing entry exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies i hadn t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings not sure why but they never came up in any of my fidelity stock screens i suspect it s because there s a lag in the data fidelity is getting from s p but haven t confirmed this they send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so i didn t have to look up the stocks on fidelity i use fidelity for basic news reading running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations looking deeply at the history of earnings results actually trading options and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity i sell puts when i see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid point in its 52 week price range in case it shoots up and then down i always set an automated exit fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options i use when selling puts it tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range i use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk i do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like gme and tsla my typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which i use to fund new call positions be wary of analyst opinions if you ve invested actively for a while you ve likely noticed a peculiar trend as a stock is cratering analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it this is not for your benefit brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts so there is inherent bias in the system i ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings they are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks one study found less than 1 issued sell recommendations what s more the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping cnbc has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms e g goldman sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right i am embarrassed to say i lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality it s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect which is tradable but it boils down to needing to do your own research good things come in pairs just about every stock has a peer or competitor most have several i stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders i ve owned visa and mastercard i own olo and tost i have a handful of um herbal medicine providers i like etsy and amzn if you bet on a small group of competitors it s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially similarly it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy what do i mean if mastercard reports low cross border transactions it s highly probable visa will be experiencing the same thing so you can use the information from mastercard to alter your position on visa exercise financial discipline even when i ve been successful picking investments i ve run into problems with how to handle my successes we ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go that s usually the moment i ve learned i should be taking some gains a few rules i try hard to follow but still screw up 1 take profits often when an option or stock hits 100 return i look to take some profit it may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call but it is just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return you can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up this ensures you cannot lose money my rationale here is simple at a 100 gain i now have more to lose than i have to gain you will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150 then down to 50 on the same positions which makes me want to break things if you find yourself up huge on an equity investment switch to options i did this for my baba position and it saved me when it hit 300 i was up 200 i sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares i had about 60k in stock and switched to something like 6k in options when baba crashed down to 150 i really didn t care much i was only down 4 5k instead of 30k i had my profit of 40k locked in so being down 4 5k was no big deal 2 fail fast if the option price sinks to 50 in value it s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to praying is not a strategy the other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as i wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date if there s negative news driving this i m out i want to fail quickly that allows me time to take the remaining 50 and generate gains with it on a better investment i think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as i tend to be an optimist 3 profit both ways if a stock i hold hits an all time high in price or valuation i look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts this enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave i hold visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings i sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts this offset a paper loss for me of 20k yesterday alone by 7 5k in gains which i secured as real profits assuming visa will recover that 7k adds 9 to this year s returns for visa 4 be patient but not greedy i have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea especially if using good tools asset managers wealth managers and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months not daily so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness example i held upstart from april to august this year and sold it because it was running flat a couple weeks later the stock tripled fml were the only words i could think of at the time the second thought i had was that i should ve bought just one call option to replace the stock i sold on the flip side once a stock does move a lot higher don t be greedy what goes up fast can come down just as fast i feel a lot worse watching a stock option go up 200 then come down all the way or more than i do exiting with a 100 gain watching the stock go up more don t chase the perfect trade it s a white whale just make money 5 everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth this is as true in boxing thanks mike as it is investing that s why it s essential to have a plan a and a plan b should plan a not work out as you thought waiting through it can work but it isn t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment so if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising covid rates and covid rates stop rising i try to have plan b ready i keep a lot of notes i track every trade i review what went wrong with trades quarterly i learn i avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest i try not to fall in love with any stock and i know that even if i lose 100k there s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if i stick it out</td>\n",

friends miss the good old days of watching live sporting events on the big screen while cheering along with the crowd would you like to be on the all star team of degenerates if you answered yes to the following questions you are in the right community and have arrived at the right place today we will be discussing the case of dave and buster s play first a quick graphic so i don t lose you so you re telling me i can start going to the arcade again thesis mr market does not fully appreciate the intrinsic value held within the core business model of dave busters play the combination deals offered by the company for food and gaming credits give patrons a unique experience and all but ensure that revenue will continue to increase as store count reaches its targeted levels we re going to break down today s presentation into the following topics introduction to dave and buster s play business model current financial condition growth potential catalyst for 2021 dave and buster s play is a leading owner and operator of high volume venues in north america that combine dining and entertainment for both adults and families founded in dallas texas in 1982 the core concept is to offer customers the opportunity to eat drink play and watch all in one location eat and drink are offered through a full menu of entrees and appetizers and a full selection of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverages play and watch offerings provide an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports after i lap you tom i m going to make love to your wife business model patrons enter dave buster s play with a choice of four options to choose from this is the core business model that differentiates dave buster s from its competitors patrons can dine in play amusement games in the midway have a seat at the bar or enjoy the big screen view of live sporting events although the company acknowledges that it is in a competitive market it is also aware that there is no other competitor that can offer all the forms of entertainment that it provides in one single location my belief is that although customer experience from competition might be similar it is not of the same scale that dave buster s is able to deliver this is because of the company s direct import program through this program dave buster s is able to acquire the latest amusement attractions games from foreign suppliers at discounted rates due to the company s size and buying power since the company is a large buyer of amusement games they receive discounts that local competitors would not be eligible for this is essential to the business model and provides for a sizeable advantage over other venues attempting to offer similar services because the company can acquire items for discounted prices it enjoys a whopping 89 3 gross margin in entertainment offerings this sector makes up 64 of the company s overall revenue being that income from entertainment is the primary source of revenue for the company dave buster s is less reliant on its food offerings this means that during times of rising food costs the company is less exposed than it would otherwise be live feed from the headquarters of dave buster s competitors their eat drink play and watch business model is broken down as follows eat patrons can choose from a menu that appeals to a broad spectrum of customers menu items include burgers and handhelds choice grade steaks and pasta there are also options available to diet conscious individuals such as vegetarian low calorie and gluten friendly delights menu items are ever evolving reflecting the changing tastes of customers drink each location offers full bar service including a variety of beers hand crafted cocktails and premium spirits play the company calls this area the midway it features a wide array of amusement and entertainment options of which some are exclusive to dave and buster s on a permanent basis this is the feature that the company feels most differentiates its brand from all others watch all locations have multiple large screen televisions and high quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports events and other immersive programming the company believes they have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience for customers current financial condition business for 2020 was significantly hampered by the economic conditions that resulted from the closures of public venues due to the covid 19 pandemic much reference is made in the company s annual report of the impact that the pandemic had on its business based on benjamin graham s principles in his book the intelligent investor heavy emphasis should not be placed on a single year s earnings for a company if there were any year that this principle applied to most it would be fiscal 2020 due to the unusual circumstances resulting from the pandemic the real appeal for why i like the stock can be found when breaking down the numbers preceding fiscal 2020 there is a consistent pattern of growth year after year for as far back as financial statements have been released for the company when comparing the numbers from 2020 to 2013 there is a 222 increase in revenue from just that period of time alone this leads me to believe that dave buster s play has a successful business model that is not only profitable but also expanding brrrrrrrrr play used proceeds from the issuance of senior secured notes along with its cash on hand to repay the principal balance of its term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility this point is of particular interest because it speaks to the credibility of a company when amid a pandemic it is able to pay down its existing debt and has not forsaken its responsibilities another sign of enthusiasm for the financial outlook of the company is the opening of five new stores in the second half of 2020 we can rely on the numbers for prior years to conclude that an increase in the number of stores equals a proportionate increase in revenue and net income as of may 2 2021 business is getting back to usual for the company 138 out of 141 stores are operating in some capacity the company believes that through its financial restructuring initiatives of the past year it has sufficient liquidity to meet estimated cash flow needs and covenant compliance obligations for the future growth potential internal studies and third party research suggest that the company has significant growth opportunities dave buster s expects to expand to over 230 stores in the future the company is well positioned to expand into new markets and expects that 2021 will be one of its best years the coming end of the covid 19 restrictions will bring about enthusiasm from the general public for the company s venues it will maintain a moderate pace of new store openings for the year and has its vision set for long term future growth a commitment to customer satisfaction weighs heavily on the company as it understands that positive experiences drive better return rates from customers dave buster s play has consistently scored higher in customer satisfaction benchmarks year after year a part of the company s initiative to bring about additional store traffic is its loyalty rewards program catalyst for 2021 dave buster s has invested time and resources in developing and implementing new technology platforms that will allow it to digitally engage customers central to this effort is the company s investment in their mobile application platform the mobile application platform resolves to enhance existing customer satisfaction and attract new customers by providing exclusive offers and discounts dave buster s intends to launch a new loyalty program in 2021 which will be integrated into the mobile application to provide further functionality and accessibility to customers i believe this initiative will be huge for the company it will serve as a direct line for delivering offers coupons to individuals who download the mobile application research has shown that customers are driven by discounts the likelihood of customers returning to stores increases significantly when coupons and offers give the customer an additional incentive to visit it is for these reasons that i believe dave buster s play will thrive and continue to expand its presence in the years ahead tldr play is the one stop shop to eat play watch drink its direct import program allows the company to cycle through the latest games and attractions for a fraction of the price given to its competitors play is looking to expand into additional markets in the years ahead it provides its existing customers loyalty rewards to keep them coming back position disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice please do your own

could this be the catalyst for a pop invest in the future not next month i m seeing a lot of comparisons going on to the bubble in 1999 with the crazy valuations going on furthermore i see the same things like 08 09 was the last time we had a serious correction and increasing covid cases with the weakening dollar could be the catalyst blah blah blah who the hell cares this fear mongering of what might happen tomorrow is some shit i m tryna leave behind in 2020 the bigger picture here is that our very landscape has changed in the last 2 decades and we have to stop being scared of change and fear of a correction can it happen sure in fact it probably should happen but will that change anything in the long term no here s a few differences between our very economy now versus what it was like 10 20 years ago we live in a day and age where more people have access to investing in our history with zero commission trading fees and apps like robinhood acorns or betterment that appeal appeal to the beginner investor the result is that the younger and younger generations are becoming more involved in the investment sector of the economy coupled with the fact that a large part of these young investors millenials and gen z do not own a home and or live with their parents they have more freedom to put their disposable income into the market what s interesting is that millennials are actually one of the most cynical generations towards the stock market mostly because we have lived through two major recessions in recent times and have a large distrust placed in large financial institutions this seems to have fundamentally changed proportion of americans who are benefitting from the stock markets bull run from an individual standpoint however with the rise of 401 k benefits offered by employers and expansion of these plans millennials are shifting more disposable income towards these options as opposed to self directed or individual plans which tells a different story we live in a day and age where new financial instruments and investing options are dominating the market popularity the historic rise of etfs approx 6 000 since 2009 have ushered in a new era of low cost diversification for the average investor employers are increasing 401 k benefits and company match policies allowing for large capital accumulation among younger investors who are reaping the benefits the rise of cryptocurrency has brought in an entirely new method to invest in the future which is particularly attractive to the younger generations who have lived through the technology era and have seen what investments in the future can look like we live in a day and age where we are exchanging information at the blink of an eye with a simple google search trend identification and data analysis in this day and age is easily accessible and a powerful tool to the average investor things such as cloud computing ai genomics blockchain green renewable energy are changing the foundation of our future and these ideas aren t going away anytime soon access to social media blogs investment forums have never been easier and will continue to advance our general education and understanding who knows what the next 10 20 or even 50 years will bring i don t know but i m certain that change is here to stay so stop worrying and embrace the unknown while i do agree with you in the fact that some of these company valuations are insane and this bull market cannot be seen as sustainable in the short run i think it s important to weigh those concerns with the macroeconomic factors that have changed the investment landscape in the last 10 20 years you should have a healthy dose of skepticism otherwise you will be caught off guard but you should also take into account the investing world is evolving and traditional metrics and guidelines in which investors have traditionally based their investment decisions on needs to adapt with it what remains true is that not all great things can last forever and a healthy correction is brewing in the future and trying to time it is and always will be the worst mistake you can make dca into your positions has and always will be no matter what the best way to invest who knows what the investment landscape will look like in 10 50 years creative destruction in our world knows no bounds and we are constantly advancing toward it change is brought on by optimism and in a 2020 lacking that heres to a forward looking future built on the backs of bulls edit 1 been getting a lot of traction and appreciation as well as hate for this post so i want to clarify a few things about what i m tryna say here 1 i am not saying invest heavy into technology clean energy or any of the other crazy shit that s been popping cause it will stay that way i am saying that look at what technology and advancements we have made just in the last 10 20 years as a global population and tried to tie it to financial advancements related to technology what will the next 50 years bring i don t know but i m excited to find out 2 i am aware that we are in uncharted waters here as a country and there are a lot of risks regarding the economy right now you d be an idiot to think that there are not going to be consequences for the amount of money printing we ve been doing the m1 money supply just shot up this last year and if we hit inflation we could be in trouble invest smart look for value average in don t buy into the hype fomo you ll be setting yourself up for some losses 3 my post is geared to a lot of the newer investors that are coming into this space trying to figure out what the fuck to do with their money a lot of them are scared about what could happen with the economic factors right now i am saying that look at us as a whole in a broader sense of the market look what we have done in the past 10 20 years as a nation and as a global population it s fucking exciting and that innovation and drive for the next generation future will never stop think long term always as a new investors you re young and can handle losses i saw a comment on another thread saying take your initial losses as tuition in learning how to invest and that is the mindset of a winner in the long run investment in yourself and making your dollar work for you is building that future and its exciting 4 stop calling me stupid naive it hurts my feelings lol i m a youngin who wants all this 2020 fear and negativity to stop and i want my fellow youngins to join me in building a better future cheers edit 2 thanks for gold again please just take this post at face value and not for what it isn t in no way shape or form should this be taken as financial advice or recommendations as everyone s situation and appetite risk is different you can nit pick my post for what it fails to cover not consider blah blah blah my point is plain and simple there s a lot of worrying going on right now in the market but investing for your future is the best thing you can do especially if you are young and haven t started</td>\n",

       "      <td>stuff for new traders no gme discussion i gotta say i see some good shit out there i see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money this is the path my fellow retards i m a nobody here but i have good returns and some good insight when i came to wsb multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck i was doing because i knew jack shit i care more about my money than yours but no retard should be left in the dark alone so let me pass on a couple things i can t prove shit to you so read this or don t i mainly trade options calls and puts so that is what i will discuss generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an etf or index while riskier this is where you can hit the homeruns so decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings while what i said is true i am usually against putting everything into a single bet anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100 guaranteed the goal of this game is to stay alive you will lose money on a play at some point because it is inevitable so never let yourself get wiped out because you can always build yourself back up this goes along with one of my other recommendations always have some cash ready to go you never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out paper hands and diamond hands are just words you ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take one of my favorite strategies is to say buy an even number of options on a play sell half at a modest level of gains like enough to break even or gain a little bit and then let the rest ride longer look guys on many plays you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red some people will bail at 40 gains and others might not take anything less than 500 just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor so you decide when it s time having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy here s a couple psychological principles in investing studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early they let their losers lose and cut off their winners short apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning think about this before you sell stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going this is why it s important to know why you got into a position trust your dd and stick to the plan i had ideas for plays where they went red right away and i bailed only to see them moon diamond hands means that you don t dump your position instantly if it goes down the hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands i m a retard and we re in a bull market so often times the stock will eventually go up your call though the market makers and big boys want you to lose they want your money i m not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use but just point out some simpler tactics they will use big money often sees retail as weak hands aka buy high and sell low they know fomo is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs we re in a bull market which means stonks only go up however we still have negative days stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad generally the dip is not time to sell but instead time to buy case and point we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago do you know what the big money did they bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap we ve been mooning ever since sometimes shit makes no sense a company can have blowout earnings exceed expectations and the stock will tank i was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the earth that day it was total bullshit and i knew it i trusted my dd so instead of panic selling i added to my position sure enough the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all time high just 2 weeks later this is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass it s easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy option expiration dates matter buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way however it can often be a noob trap one bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position stocks trade sideways sometimes sometimes they don t do what you think they should do and sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason so give yourself time to work with time costs money and hurts profit margins but it is better to consistently make 50 profit than to hit one play for 300 followed by 10 losers look playing weekly stupidly otm calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits i do at least one or more every week the key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit remember no tendies no more fun along the same lines strike price matters an otm out of the money option means that the strike price is a bit of a ways from where the stock s price currently is otm options give huge profit margins the further you go out i personally enjoy using them some people don t but my advice is to balance risk with profit potential if your call relies on a stock gaining 50 in 2 weeks then well it s probably not gonna happen itm in the money options means that your stock is already within the strike price itm is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need leaps are fuckin dope a leap is a call but for a much longer period of time i m using the term loosely because we re degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap given that the market trends up over time you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way a lot of people buy itm leaps but again i m a degenerate and go otm a lot implied volatility iv extremely fucking important iv is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction high iv expensive options it s fucking weird to think but you can make similar profits from a 2 move on a low iv stock as you can from a 5 move on a more volatile stock low iv is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon high iv is riskier so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves buying an option on a stock right before earnings report er will be more expensive due to iv trying to play er is usually for suckers unless you have some really good dd about why a company might deliver a huge surprise one of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into er the company will deliver great news and then dump hard you may see people bitching about this very soon basically big money knew ahead of time it would be good so the stock got pumped and then they took profits buy the rumor and sell the news events press releases and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap you will get shit on ask someone about tesla battery day positive rumors will send a stock soaring though finally get busy learning read about options on investopedia and any other things you do not understand the big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we re doing to take our money learn about the general market stocks are grouped into sectors or categories start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going i didn t even mention half of the shit that goes on in options so that s on you the first thing you need to do is to learn what the greeks are that will teach you how options function if anyone wants to talk or discuss send me a message i m a degenerate with no life oh and if you follow someone s dd and lose money that s on you i ve come up with some genius shit but i ve also lost on some retarded calls nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20 20 may the gains be with you</td>\n",
